    We now know that we are souls. And our eternal Father is the Supreme soul. Rajyog is the process of uniting with our Father. The word "yog" means to add or to join. We become like the one we focus on. When the soul gets lost in remembrance of the Supreme Soul, the qualities of God gets transferred to us. Also our own virtues gets activated. This empowers us to master our senses and become "Raja" or the king of our own self. We gain control. 
    <br><br><br>

    <br>
    Prayer is a one sided communication between the child and Father, where the child recites a prayer, or sings a hymn, or reads verses from the holy books. However these prayers, verses or hymns are written by some great devotees who experienced God. When we repeat them, we do not understand the meaning of the powerful words and just recite them like parrots. Hence we fail to feel the love and affection for God.
   <br><br>
   <img id="pr"src="images\avatar\prayer.jpg">
   
   
    <hr>
<p id="r">Rajyog meditation is a two sided communication. Here the soul or the child feels close to the Father and feels immense love for Him. In return we experience the deep and unconditional love of God or our Father. This fills us with supersensous joy. The soul is rejuvenated and now our happiness is beyond our senses. This means we no longer seek approval, support, appreciation, love.. And we do not need any reason to be happy.</p>
    <hr>
    <hr>
<mark>We tried to connect with great souls by meeting them, conversing with them or by listening to them. We visited places of worship. We went for pilgrimages. When we returned, we felt positive and vibrant. However it was shortlived. This is because no soul with a physical body is powerful enough to empower another soul permanently. We need to connect with the perfect soul and that is the Supreme soul to gain everlasting happiness.</mark>

    <hr>
    <br>
<p>In the past we tried to reach God through someone be it a diety or a guru or a priest. In Rajyoga meditation we connect directly to the source.</p>    
<hr>
<p id="r">It is believed in India that going for pilgrimages and bathing in holy rivers can purify us. Going for pilgrimages may give us temporary satisfaction of fulfulling our duties towards God. Dipping our bodies in rivers can only clean the body. Performing rituals can only keep us occupied for sometime. But to cleanse ourselves we need to dip ourself in the Ocean of Purity. Only by connecting with the Ever Pure Supreme soul, can the soul regain its lost purity. And this is Rajyog meditation.</p>

Relax your body completely starting from your toes, to knees, to stomach, to shoulders, to neck to your facial muscles. Release all your tensions, stress and heaviness. Forget all your problems and keep them aside for some time. Feel as if you are home, your true home where you can totally relax. Take deep breaths. Feel as it everything is good and there is no need to worry. Preferred time is early morning 4-5AM, and evening 6-8PM as the atmosphere is less noisy.</p>

That is who you are. Visualise your body and realise that this is not you. It is only the costume that you are wearing to express yourself. While focussing, thoughts of work, relations, people etc would come to divert your attention. Calmly observe them and understand they are not true. Watch them leave and continue with the thought. You are bodiless.You are a soul.</p>

But this time you are the one who guides the mind to create the thoughts. Contemplate on your original nature of love, purity, bliss, happiness, knowledge, power and peace. See yourself in your sweet silence home as a soul. The soul world is bright golden red in color. It welcomes you with deep peaceful vibrations. Feel the peace. Feel the silence. Feel the worryfree atmosphere. Feel the deep relief of finally being at home. Feel yourself as a point of light. Completely bodiless.</p>

All our life we never paid any attention to our thoughts. We let them come, carry us away wherever it wants and make us distracted. We never tried to control them or ever worried about the quality of our thoughts. We always thought it did not affect us anyway. But it does. Now the mind is out of control and drags us away with negative and unnecessary thoughts. The thoughts now behave like children all grown up and wild because no discipline was taught during their childhood. Rajyog is all inner work. The technique is all about the mind, intellect, thoughts & how to work on them.</p>

About the physical eyes, we keep them open as we communicate with our Supreme Father and any communication does not involve closing eyes. Also as we connect with the divine, positive vibrations are transmitted through the eyes purifying the atmosphere. Now when we sit to meditate, thoughts will come to interrupt us. Observe them come as if they are uninvited guests. Look at them from a distance with your mind's eye as if they are not yours. As if you are separate from the thoughts. Keep a guard on them as they continue to come. Guide the mind to think about the real you. At the same time observe the stray thoughts. Do not let them stay. Do not let them pull  you away. Be on guard. Instead replace them with thoughts about the real you. The soul. Watch the negative thoughts disappear.</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >As you think so you become. Everything that you see around you is a manifestation of what you thought in the past. Everything that comes to you good or bad is a result of how you thought in the past. Thoughts have vibrations that radiate into the universe and returns back to you manifold whether you want or not. Knowing this, we can now change the mind from running in auto control to manual control. We can create thoughts consciously that can benefit us and everyone around us. We take control and ensure that we replace all negative and waste thoughts into positive and elevated thoughts. What are positive and elevated thoughts? They are thoughts about universal welfare, love and acceptance for all souls. They are thoughts beyond the body and the physical world and realisation of being a soul. They are thoughts about our creator who is beyond perfection and the more we think about Him we start becoming like Him. They are thoughts about the knowledge delivered by the Supreme soul directly through His human medium.</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >We make friends with whom we share similar thinking, habits and tastes. In Rajyoga meditation we build a relationship with God, the Supreme soul, the Highest of High. This is not an ordinary thought. Only the fortunate ones get to befriend God Himself. But God Himself offers his hand to us for friendship. However we must be similar to enjoy our friendship. God is the purest of pure, inexperienced about vices and all kinds of negativity. To accept His hand, we must become a new person with new habits and filled with positivity. The most elevated soul is repelled by the five main vices-lust, anger, greed, attachment, ego. So to become God's friend we need to make some changes in our life. The soul itself is viceless but acquired the vices after taking many births. The practice to realize oneself as a soul will take one closer to God. Because He is bodiless.</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >The soul has been on a journey of many human births. Each birth the soul gets a new physical costume, new relations, new life to perform the new role. As soon as the role gets over, the soul leaves for another new body. This has been continued for maximum 5000 years and for maximum 84 births. Now the soul is in the last leg of its journey. During this process the soul is drained out of its energy and needs replenishment. However the energy must come from the Supreme Charger who is forever charged & energized, who never gets into the cycle of births & deaths and who is only capable of rejuvenating us. This is Rajyog meditation when I the soul connect to the Supreme Charger and recharge myself. However it is not a one time process. It has to be regularly and diligently practiced. Just as a mobile needs to be recharged each day to function properly, so I the soul need to be connected to my Source each day.</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >Rajyog meditation is the deepest spiritual science and one requires guidance. One has to learn the techniques correctly in order to get the desired results. Just as a child gets admission in a school in order to start their academic life. The child is exposed to a proper atmosphere that aids learning, teachers to guide them and companions to learn together. One must join the nearest Brahmakumari center and start their spiritual education in a formal way. Rajyoga meditation is not a regular "satsang" to come and listen to religious discourses, like in other places. This is spiritual education that one receives and the teacher is none other than God Himself. Here it is not about reading from scriptures, but live classes of meditation and spiritual studies. Here it is about implementing the learnings in our real life. So it is named as Godly University for deep spiritual education that can transform our lives. And God our Father is not limited to any gender, religion, caste, color, nationality or any group. So is the University. It is open to all. </p>

        <p>Purity in thoughts, words and action is of utmost importance when it comes to practicing meditation. It starts with the mind as it is infected with the five vices-lust, anger, greed, attachment and ego. If we cleanse the mind, our words and actions will automatically get cleansed. If we wish to master Rajyoga meditation it is important to stay away from the five major vices by understanding what harm it has done to us. Our greatest enemies lie within us, unseen, silently attacks us and robs us of our purity. Without purity we cannot come closer to God.</p>

          <p>You are what you eat. As you eat so will be your thoughts. Our food directly impacts our mind. To harness the restless mind, food that cause agitation & intoxication, is hot, pungent, impure should be avoided. Food that is pure, comes from plant source, is cooked mildly and can be offered to God is edible for Rajyogi practioner. It should be prepared with purity, happiness, love and positivity so that these vibrations pass on to the dish. Also offering to the Supreme energy first, signifies gratitude, humility and thankfulness. The food gets charged with the pure vibrations of the Supreme energy and is as good as heavenly nectar.  </p>

          <p>A man is known by the company he keeps. As a Rajyogi practioner it is advisable to seek the company of only God as He is only the true companion. However since we are human beings with physical bodies we can selectively choose who we should mingle with. They should be ones who love God, are interested in His words, abides by what He teaches and leads a pure life. As we continue to practice Rajyog, we would ourselves be drawn away from negative company or company that do not serve us and that may also include selective content from social media, contact groups, entertainment world, and reading materials. </p>

          <p>Rajyog meditation is connection with the Highest of High. He is the Ocean of Virtues. Since we are in a relationship with God, we should work on ourselves to inculcate elevated values and virtues in our life. Shri Krishna becomes a diety after intense practice of Rajyog meditation, is blessed with divine virtues, is 16 celestial degrees full and is next to God. As a Rajyogi practioner we should consciously cultivate good habits, embrace divine virtues, become like a diety and spread the fragrance of our goodness wherever we go.  </p>

        </h2>
        <p class="text-info text-bold">
          Start experiencing peace, love, kindness, bliss and happiness. It is the nature of the soul to be relaxed and stable but bodyconsciousness robbed us of our peace of mind. With regular practice, experience a stable mind that does not react, but respond to situations. Feel your anxiety, nervousness, stress and anger gradually disappear. Bid goodbye to all your worries as you are comforted and cared for by God. Slowly a feeling of goodwill towards all, start emerging and our biased attitude fades away. When the mind becomes calm and peaceful, it starts showing its positive impact on your physical health too. There is also harmony in relationships.

Become powerful enough to stop unnecessary thinking, learn to nip them in the bud with a powerful brake. Steer them towards perfection. Find your concentration power and efficiency increase.

God is the purest of pure and is ever pure. He is not a soul but the Supreme soul, the ocean of purity. Our Father is devoid of vices but we the souls His children are stained with vices. The soul was originally pure but with repeated births and contact with vices, the purity is lost. When we become soul conscious and direct our thoughts on the purity of our Father we start receiving powerful vibrations from Him and the process of purification starts. When we focus our mind's energy on the qualities of our Father, slowly those qualities start coming back to us. The soul starts shedding the negativities that lie hidden deep within.

With daily practice of Rajyog meditation, one starts feeling distant from gossip, vulgarity, negativity, impure food, worldly entertainment etc. Positivity will start dominating every aspect of one's life and one would automatically start making the correct choices. Attitude of giving would start emerging from within. One would stop asking and taking from others. Rajyoga meditation unlocks our untouched virtues and one would feel empowered enough to stop expecting from others. One would feel mentally and physically self sufficient. Self motivation, enthusiasm, happiness without a reason and overall positivity would become our nature.

            Taking multiple births and wearing different physical costumes has made the soul attached to the bodies. The result is body consciousness. A Rajyogi practices being Soul conscious and God conscious after understanding the concept of the Soul and Supreme soul. Gradually both practices together brings back the memories of being a perfect humanbeing, once upon a time. These memories start emerging from the subconscious mind. The divinity was hidden under layers of vices accumulated over the years and ages. As the vices start loosing their grip from the soul and gets washed away, the diety inside us gets revealed. This transformation happens with constant and intense practice of Rajyog meditation and is the ultimate goal.

          The familiar scene of Arjun on his chariot, and the charioteer Shri Krishna, who encourages, motivates and 
          injects courage into Arjun's mind as he loses strength to fight the battle. How can God the father of all beings provoke
          anyone to kill? How come the enemies are at a standstill and waits patiently for Arjun to finish his lessons? Here Shri Krishna represents
          the Supreme soul, the Father of all souls, who is unborn and bodiless. In order to teach the human souls how to survive the dangerous
          inner war and come out as a winner, He needs a body with a mouth to speak. He takes a human medium, and speaks through his mouth. The human medium is shown as Arjun, his chariot as the body and the charioteer as Krishna. So both are shown in the same chariot representing the same body with both the soul and the Supreme soul in it.
Krishna advises Arjun to fearlessly kill using his weapons, without any doubt or guilt. The Father of all souls commands us the souls to kill the inner vices-lust, anger, greed, attachment & ego, with the weapons of knowledge that he shares with us.
Also Krishna himself never participates in the fight, but only guides Arjun. Clearly this means we the souls are required to fight our own battle to tame our mind, and He will support and guide us.
Kurukshetra means the place (kshetra) of action (kuru), or this corporeal world which represents a battle field where we are fighting our own battle. To understand this deep knowledge, requires thorough understanding. Please visit the nearest Brahmakumaries center, if interested.

          As promised God comes in the end of every cycle to rejuvenate the world that is old and is in the verge of 
          collapsing. He transforms the old world into new. Iron aged world into Golden aged world. He destroys all religions and establishes one religion. But He needs to come 
          to this corporeal world from his Supreme abode in the 6th realm, in order to perform this task. He used a human medium known as Lekhraj Kripalini, renames him as Prajapita Brahma.
          Brahma plays an important role as an instrument in recreating the world, all done by the Supreme energy. God reminds him of his previous births and showed a glimpse of his future birth as Shri Krishna as a child, and later as Sri Narayan
          when he ascends the throne as the Emperor of the World. Brahma in this birth and then Vishnu in the next birth. The Supreme soul is not 
          born like normal human beings from the womb of a mother. He incarnates himself by taking the support of another's body, as mentioned
          as "parkaya pravesh" in the scriptures. The human body is often referred to as a vehicle used by a soul to express itself. In the 
          scriptures it is called "rath" or a chariot. The Father of all souls uses the chariot (body) of Brahma to destroy the old world and make it into new, fresh and pure. 
          So Prajapita Brahma is shown as Arjun, the Supreme energy as Krishna and the body of Brahma as the chariot, in the scriptures.

          When irreligiousness reaches the heights and a stage of no repair, it is then that God descends on this earth to mend it. He comes to Bharat as no other place has reached the most downfall. If Bharat is repaired,
          the whole world would be repaired. Time is cyclic and repeats itself after completion of a cycle. The first beautiful phase
          is the golden period of perfect human world where humans existed in the form of deities. Time turned and it changed to Silver period,
          Copper period, Iron period and then the end of the Iron period, after which is the upcoming Golden period again. 
          As time keeps spinning and we reached the end of the cycle after taking multiple births since the golden period, 
          we are now in the Iron period-the dark age. This is
          the age when we souls lost all wisdom, and got ourselves stained with impurity by indulging in the five vices-lust, anger, greed, attachment
          and ego. The world may have advanced technologically, but human souls lost their divinity, purity, peace, happiness and became powerless. Inspite
          of material progress every soul is weak, deformed and is seeking the truth. It is not in the capacity of any human soul to restore the lost glory of Bharat, and 
          also the world. Only and only the Supreme power, the purest of pure who is untouched by vices can rejuvenate the sick world. As He promised, it is the time when he comes
          and transforms this old world into new. He creates heaven on earth. Bharat is now hell, and the same hell turns into 
          heaven when the human souls are purified by the Father of souls. He prescribes the medicine of complete purity. He Himself teaches the art and science of Rajyoga. If we can master ourselves, we can master the world. If we change, the world changes. This time is the end of the dark age and the beginning of the golden age, the transformation age that will last only for a few more years from now.

          Shrimat-the greatest ordinance, Bhagavat Gita-the song of God. The most elevated knowledge taught directly by God Himself is like music
          to the ears and is referred to as song(geet), flute(murli), lute(veena) and power drum(damru). If listened and implemented in our lives it
          purifies and empowers the soul and so it is referred to as nectar(amrit), river(ganga), lake(sarovar), ocean(sagar), milk(doodh) etc. Drinking any liquid may 
          nourish the body, but cannot empower the soul. Bathing and washing the body can clean the body, but cannot cleanse the soul. Listening to music can 
          can entertain us, but cannot change our lives. It is all about the great wisdom bestowed upon us by none other than the Supreme Father, who speaks 
          through the lotus mouth of Brahma as he needs to communicate with human souls. He shares the secrets of the soul & the Supreme soul, mysteries of the Universe, 
          deepest knowledge about karma, the cycle of time, the tree of humanity, wisdom about elevated deeds, many hidden truths, about our eternal home and the entire ocean of knowledge. 
          God Himself descends on this earth to talk to his children and treat them from the disease of vices that has infected the soul. He is also well known as 
          the Supreme doctor(Vaidyanath). This knowledge is meant for all irrespective of gender, class, country, color, creed or religion. He is the Supreme Teacher who is unbiased and 
          every soul has a right to learn about this Godly knowledge. He does not read from the scriptures or any holy books as He Himself is the Ocean of knowledge. On the contrary, He clarifies all the misconceptions, doubts, misunderstandings and wrong beliefs. He provides a summary of everything thats written in the scriptures.
          Thats why they show Brahma, a bearded man in white with four heads with scriptures in his hand. It is only symbolic of the knowledge being spread all around the world.
