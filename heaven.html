    <p id="r">Different religions have different views on the most elevated place called heaven. Most 
      believe that heaven is somewhere up in the sky. People in India believe that one reaches heaven, 
      when they die. Some feel that it is the place 
      where God resides. However every one desires to go there. Still others are trying to find it, 
      calling it, Paradise lost. Space scientists are exploring different planets, as their deepest desire 
      is to locate "heaven" hidden somewhere</p>

<p id="r">When life gets harsh, and the circumstances are unfavourable one turns to God. In their weakest 
  moment one requests God to take them to heaven. They think dying is the best solution as they can 
  enter heaven. With this belief some even take their own lives when excruciatingly painful life gets impossible to tolerate. Another belief 
  is that if one is killed in the battle field, one goes to heaven.</p>

        Matter changes according to our inner state of mind. When our mind is in the highest state, 
        everything outside manifests in its perfection. Time is cyclic and turns in a loop. In the beginning of the cycle, 
        when humans knew no vices and were in their purest form, this place was called heaven and the time was the golden period. 
        The human beings were called dieties or next to God. It is this same Earth in its most elevated state. 
        People think heaven is skyward due to the collective highly superior state of mind of 
        atleast 33 crores of souls. They are next to God, but not God. They had once fallen from grace, but later rose once 
      again. </p>

        where humans lose their purity and drowns in vices. Hell is not some place underground with scary demons waiting to

        dieties (sundar) become demons (shyaam) 
        or in their impurest state. They are referred to as fallen angels or falling stars by some. But things change. 
        The work of transforming the souls back to their purest state can only be done by 
        the Supreme soul Himself. He has incarnated again, to change humans into dieties and as a result the earth transforms into heaven. The 
        time to evolve is now, and God has named this small period of transformation as 
        the Confluence age (Time after Kalyug & before Satyug), or Purshottam Sangam yug (the time when the souls meet the Supreme soul)
        . Self transformation leads to World transformation</p>

        produce and no one knew scarcity. Gold, diamond and precious jewels were freely available and so the 
        palaces are decorated extravagantly. Flora and fauna were of the best quality and the world was magnificent.

Whoever said that to reach heaven one must die victorious in the battle 
field is right. We are in the battlefield fighting the 5 major vices with the weapons of Godly knowledge, 
the power of Rajyoga meditation and God's unwavering support in each step. It is not easy to become victorious as 
Satan or vices show up wearing masks and it takes a sharp mind to identify it and then use the right weapon to destroy 
it. Also God is only going to lead us, guide us and advise us, but not to fight for us. Hence only a very few win this 
battle and qualify for heaven. Heaven is a vicefree world and one needs to attain complete purity & perfection. Only Rajyoga 
meditation taught by God Himself can help us become eligible for heaven.

        There are images of Shri Krishna meditating. However when the soul attains perfection there is no need 
        to practice any form of mental discipline. Krishna is next to God and is filled with divine virtues and complete perfection. 
        How did he attain that status? 
        Shri Krishna in his previous birth, in the form of Brahma learned 
        Rajyoga meditation from the Supreme soul, and practiced it with dedication. He could defeat his inner enemies 
        by fighting against them with strength, courage, determination and full faith in God. He realised himself as a 
        soul and our Father as the Supreme soul 
        from the deepest level. He had the most powerful connection with the source. As a result, he attained perfection. 
        Brahma was reborn as Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna was crowned as the world emperor with the title Shri Narayan. This world became heaven.

Human souls have the power to awaken the divinity within, 
hidden under layers and layers of impurity with God's help. This impurity is accumulated in 63 births and is deeply 
set in the soul. After changing bodies 63 times, the soul gets accustomed to wearing bodily costumes 
and becomes totally body conscious. Human beings then lose their divinity. Only the Supreme soul, 
our eternal Father has the cabability of changing humans back to dieties. And when humans turn 
into dieties, the world transforms into heaven. Dieties dwelled in heaven, and were humans too. However they were qualified 
as 16 celestial degrees full, complete with all virtues, non violent, viceless, and law abiding. They were titled as Gods and Goddesses 
because they were almost God like. But they were only humans in their complete perfection and were next to God, not God.

When human souls conquer their vices and reach the highest level of purity, it is then that the world changes from hell to heaven. We are now 
in "hell", the darkest place full of sorrow and vices. Heaven is the brightest, vibrant, happiest and the perfect place. Its us
humans responsible for bringing heaven and hell with our actions. Whoever said life is not perfect, this world is not perfect and humans are not perfect is correct. 
At this time we are in hell and nothing is perfect. However there was a time of perfection. That time was heaven. 
It is like a magical world where nature responded to the humans and they enjoyed health, wealth and happiness. No one heard about deformity, sickness, 
death, oldage, poverty, depression, lust, greed, anger, attachment, ego and anything negative. Life was peaceful with no worries. 
Even animals and birds were well behaved.

Dieties became dieties only because of their level of purity in thoughts, words and action. During the 
golden period the human souls were 100% pure and completely viceless. This means they had no knowedge of lust, 
attachment, greed, pride, ego, anger. They are naturally soul conscious and had childlike innocence. Love was pure 
and filled with affection, good wishes and care. Dieties loved each other beyond their sense organs 
and without any conditions. They were truly non violent. They bore children with the power of mind. Infact they 
did everything using their powerful thoughts. Imitating the dieties, even the animals and birds were pure, vice free, well 
mannered and friendly. Nature responded to this by obeying the thought commands of the dieties. Just as God is the Ocean of purity, 
He created human beings in his own image and they were worshipped later as dieties.
      </p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >
Human beings during the Golden period had 100% perfect bodies. The reason is because the soul was 
100% perfect. If the soul is flawless without any stain, the body acquired is flawless too. No one was born blind, 
deaf, dumb or with any defect. Babies smiled the moment they were born. Their bodies 
were always healthy and they were unaware of sickness. Though they aged, their bodies never lost their 
charm and lustre. When they completed average 150 years of life span they willingly changed their bodies 
for another. Dieties had naturally beautiful appearance without any effort. They were dressed in clothes 
made of the best quality fabrics designed for comfort and style. Their garments were studded with precious gems that shone bright. 
Their jewellery were of the purest gold embedded with rare stones. 
      </p>

During the golden period or in heaven, relationships were simple, sweet and comforting. They knew of no ill feelings, 
jealousy, revenge, hatred or any other negative emotions. No one competed with each other with any negative intentions. They lived 
with lots of love in their hearts that was true and unconditional. Dieties were affectionate, helpful, caring, friendly and happy with no 
expectations from any one. The Emperor and the Empress treated the subjects like their own children. They spoke less as they understood 
each other without any explanation. There were no arguments, debates, gossips, disagreements and sulking. They were fully civilised and spoke 
sweetly in soft tones. Dieties had good relationship with nature too, 
and never broke any rules. Animals and birds 
were friendly and helpful.

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12" >
Dieties consume plant based natural food. As nature is in full bloom and is in its purest form, the produce is freshest, 
nutritious, organic and delicious. The earth produces on its own (swayambhu or exists on its own). The 
trees are laden with the most exotic, aromatic, juicy and delicious fruits that offer 
themselves to the dieties to be plucked. The taste varies from sweet, salty, flavourful to mildly sour. Some of the 
vegetables are solar cooked and they simply need to be plucked and placed on dishes. The coverings of 
the fruits come with attractive packaging. The attendants of the Emperor and Empress do not need to cook as 
everything is available in a ready to be served style. The food is so nutritious that it leaves them satiated 
without a second helping. The air is purest of pure with mild fragrance wafting around. The water is like tonic, 
flavoured with medicinal herbs and drinking it makes one 
immediately refreshed. There is no food that is pungent, hot, spicy, too salty, too sour, bitter and anything 
that causes intoxication.

Dieties earned the most extravangant and luxurious life owing to their most elevated state of mind that they achieved in their 
past birth by learning Rajyoga Meditation. After they were reborn as dieties in heaven, they no longer needed to make any 
effort. Everything was served to them by nature. Huge palaces made of gold, studded with precious stones were 
offered to them, complete with personal attendants. In fact, during the Golden Period gold, silver, diamonds and gems were freely available 
and no one 
hankered after them. They travelled in aerial crafts that flew smooth and fast. Everything was controlled with 
the power of mind. The palaces were lit up with the glow of the diamonds and invisible, wireless, bright lights. They were awakened 
by the singing of birds, 
and rustling of leaves that produced music. Their attendants dressed them and laid out a feast. Dieties were wealthy and prosperous. 
We have seen images
 of Shri Lakshmi and Shri Narayan fully decked up and adorned with jewels and that is symbolic of their rich life in heaven.

          Do you know about the Shiv Linga? It is a symbol (linga) of the point of light the form of our Supreme father. He is an energy 
          and resembles a dot. In order to worship and perform our rituals a model is created in a bigger size. The red dot is shown 
          between the three lines. He is the Ocean of Knowledge and knows the past, present and future and that is represented 
          by the three lines. But why is the color black? Because only He has the potential to absorb our negativities and yet 
          remain uninfluenced. It is only to show how everyone donates their vices, impurities and negativities to Him as He is 
          capable of transforming them into virtues. He drinks our poison yet does not get poisoned Himself, shown as NeelKanth.<br>
          In order to welcome purity into our lives, let us donate our inner weaknesses, vices and shortcomings to the Supreme 
          soul. These vices caused us utmost 
          misery since many births. In return our Father gifts us the kingdom of Heaven. In other words, we become eligible to enter the pure zone.

We the souls are covered in dirt, impurities and obstinate stains collected over many births. If we listen to 
the most elevated knowledge each day, its like 
dipping ourselves in a cleansing solution. The stains would slowly loosen its grip. The cleansing process would start. Just as we bathe our 
bodies each day, the soul needs to be bathed on a daily basis. The knowledge is shared directly by God and one who listens to it and also imbibes it in their lives can 
see visible changes. The divinity within would gradually start showing up. This is the song of God, realtime, sung 
directly by God and it is live. It has been praised in the scriptures as nectar, somras and amrit. It sounds music to the ears and so its compared to musical instruments, and we call it "Murli". For that we may need to visit the nearest center and become a Godly student.

Rajyog Meditation is union of the soul with the Supreme soul. This process empowers the soul and the hidden powers 
along with divine virtues get evoked. The soul gradually gains mastery over the sense organs and the thoughts. 
This is called awakening. Devotees ring bells in the temple to awaken the memory of divinity of the diety souls. However its 
not any external sound that can arouse the soul. Only communion of the soul with its source can revive it once again. Only the 
Supreme soul has the capacity to rejuvenate the soul. This requires regular practice and is not a one time affair. The vices, old beliefs 
and habits that are so hard to get rid of can be burnt with the power of yoga or union. Only then the divine virtues will get revealed. This 
needs proper training, and one is advised to visit a Brahmakumari center.

The knowledge shared directly by God is not from any book or scripture. It is directly flowing from the Ocean of Knowledge. 
Its a diamond opportunity to be able to hear it, understand it and then imbibe it. However, thats not it. The pearls or wisdom must 
not be kept to oneself. It should be shared so that many souls too get the chance to meet their long lost Supreme Heavenly Father, and 
hear the elevated knowledge. Prasadam is distributed amongst all. The belief is that the more we distribute, the more blessings and good 
fortune gets generated. This comes from the fact that the gift of God, the nectar of knowledge should not be kept to oneself. The more you give, 
the more you get. One's treasure of knowledge would increase manifold.

          We imagine "hell" as a place underground or in another planet that is specially designed for punishment 
          of souls after death. However "hell" is not a place. It is not another planet. The Earth is hell. And 
          it is hell now. God never created this hell. He gifted us heaven. We enjoyed the gift for 2500 years known as the time of
          the Golden & Silver periods. However, as soon as time changed to Copper age, we changed too. We misused the heavenly 
          treasures and the world became hell.  Every soul gets punished here due to our misdeeds. That is why violence, pollution, drugs, depression, 
          adulteration, 
          opression, filth is found everywhere. We got 
          used to it, and accepted it as normal. Now we do not even know that we are living in hell. That is the irony.

          How did this happen? God created heaven for us and left us to enjoy peace, prosperity, health and 
          happiness. After 2500 years we destroyed it with our actions. Now there are no traces of heaven. When we were 
          deities, we did not know what sin was. We were in harmony with nature. There was purity. There was love. However, 
          we committed sins after sins. Ofcourse unknowingly. We lost our wisdom and failed to distinguish between wrong and 
          right. We broke all laws. The law of Karma means every action has an equal and opposite reaction. We manifested this 
          sad world. Its time to take the 
          responsibility. Its time to reform. Its time to change our karma.

          Bharat was praised as the golden bird, the land of gold, silver and precious stones, the richest land of dieties and later 
          kings. In the beginning, there were no countries except Bharat. So Bharat has seen the best times when it was 
          paradise. This means it is the  oldest country in the world. The other lands emerged from the ocean after the Copper period.
          Why does God come only to Bharat? Bharat has fallen the most. The place that was once heaven turns into hell, first. 
          So here we are. When Bharat falls, the whole world falls gradually. Hence God comes to correct only 
          Bharat. Bharat is the first hell.

         What is the only reason for the big fall from heaven to hell? We dont have to look outside. In Mahabharat it was shown that the 
         enemies of Pandavs were their own family members who they never suspected. This is just a way of explaining that the one who back 
         stabbed us 
         are invisible. That is because they are not external or physical. They are inside each one of us. They are hidden. They are majorly 
         named as lust, anger, greed, attachment and ego. Each one comes with many more secret army of vices. Yes vices are the cause of our 
         downfall. Vices are best represented by reptiles, scary creatures and rodents in the scriptures. They are given names like Ravan, Maya, Akasur, Bakasur, 
         Mahisasur, devils, satan etc.
