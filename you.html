 Hello this is me..

<h1>My name is Bindi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I am 24 years old</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>I am a teacher</span></h1>

<p>
    Isn't this how we start our introduction? Here we are identifying ourself with the body. The name of the body, the age of the body, the address of the body, the profession of the body.
    But am I the body?
    <br>
    If I am the body then whey do we say "MY body is tired", "MY eyes are beautiful", "MY legs are aching"??
    <hr>
<p>So there is a difference between "I" and "MY" here. I am not the body. Ofcourse the body is mine!Then who am I??</p>
    <hr>
    <hr>
<mark>I am the energy that controls the body. I am the controller, the operator. Without me the body is just a doll. This energy may have different names-Soul, Spirit, Aatma, Rooh..</mark>

    <hr>
    <br>
<p>A car is useless without a driver. And so the body is lifeless without the soul.</p>    

<p>The driver can drive only when seated in the driver's seat. And so the soul drives the body from the center of the forehead known as "seat of soul". It is also known as the third eye. Opening the third eye simply means being conscious that I am a soul, and I see others as souls too.</p>    
<hr>
<p>This is the eternal truth. We are but souls operating our bodies from the center of our forehead. If we leave, the body wont function and needs to be discarded. So the name of the body is gone. Bindi was only the name of the body, and not mine. The introduction that I thought was mine is now over. I understand that was only my TEMPORARY introduction as long as the body lasts.</p>

<hr>
<mark>The soul is a tiny spark of light or a spiritual energy that is unviewable with the physical eyes. The very fact that I stand, I eat, I sleep, I work proves that I am alive or I am present in the body. Though invisible its presence can be felt as the body functions</mark>

    <hr>

<p>The real me is the "soul". I am the soul, the owner, and the master of the body. My sense organs are at my command and not vice versa. I can control my sense organs and use them whenever I require. I wont allow my sense organs to control me. I am a powerful soul. I am conscious and I am alert. I am awakened. This is my REAL introduction, my PERMANENT introduction</p>

  <h1>My Habits or Sansksar</h1>
  <hr><hr>
  <h2><kbd>How Are Habits Formed??</kbd></h2>
  <p>Another word for habits are "Impressions". When any action is repeated multiple times, it forms an impression in the mind. The act gets imprinted and stamped in the subconscious or the deepest layer of the mind</p>
<br>
<h3><b>Now that it is embedded in the subconscious mind, next time the same action does not need conscious effort. It becomes automatic and natural. Now its my habit. Or its my "sanskar"</b></h3>

<br>
<img src="images\avatar\smoker.jpg">
<h5><kbd>When a person smoked for the first time, it did not become a habit. However when the person keeps repeating the act whether he enjoys it or not simply becomes a habit as the impression has formed in the subconscious mind. It is the same with good habits!</kbd></h5>
<mark>The soul has three faculties: Mind, Intellect and Habit</mark><br>
<span>
<img src="images\avatar\faculties.jpg">
<hr>
<h3>Mind is the first faculty of the soul that creates thoughts continuously. Brain is a part of the body and not soul. It is a machine that aids the soul as long as it lasts. If not trained it will run wild and create thoughts naturally as per the previous habits of the soul. </h3>
<hr>
<h3>Intellect is the second faculty that creates visuals as per the thoughts coming from the mind. It can provide suggestions, gives advices and is called the conscience or "vivek"</h3>
<hr>
<h3>If the intellect passes any act from the second faculty, and if the act is performed many times, it gets stored as a habit in the soul, very popularly known as "karma". This travels with the soul till the next body if stored quite deep.</h3>
<hr>

<h2><kbd>Each soul has carried habits from 5 places</kbd></h2>

Taking many births we have accumulated loads of karma, good or bad. The good deeds will fetch me good returns either in the same birth or the next. Same goes with the bad karma.

        <p class="p_modal">I am a soul, a divine energy that controls the body. I am a tiny point of light. My Father is a soul too. But not an ordinary soul, He is the Supreme Soul, the Father of all souls. He is a point of light too, as He is my Father.<br>I reside in my body. But the Supreme soul does not take births, nor does he ever die. So he does not have any body. He is untouched by any vices and is the purest of pure energy. He is named as per his duty of doing good to all, and it is "Shiv". It means one who wants the welfare of every being.<br>

He is forever worshipped and never becomes the worshipper. He is the Highest of High. There is no one above Him. He does not have a parent, teacher, friend, guide or any caretaker. He is self born and exists forever.<br>

        <p class="p_modal">God lives in a place above earth, space, sky and beyond all where no human can reach with their bodies on. It is a place where all souls rest. It is golden orange in color and transmits vibrations of silence, purity, love, peace, power and unconditional acceptance. We souls lived there before we wore bodily costumes to play our parts in the worldly drama. However the drama is soon going to be over and its time to go home again. And our Father is here to take us there. But He must purify ourselves first as no one can enter home, without being pure. He teaches us how to connect with Him.<br>

        <p class="p_modal">Our physical relations are temporary and lasts only for one life. However our relation with the Supreme Father is for ever. Its time to have a relationship with Him directly and empower ourself. If we connect with souls we can never receive energy as they are themselves in need of energy. However God the source of all energy, can rejuvenate me and activate all my positive virtues hidden within me. Just as a mobile needs charging, we souls need charging too. We do not connect a mobile with another, but with the charging point. Similarly to revive and purify ourself, God is the one we need to connect with. Only the purest of pure can purify us. And only purification can lead to complete happiness.<br>
